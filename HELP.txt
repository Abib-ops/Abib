Introduction.
-------------

The name Abib, is the old name for the Jewish month Nisan.  Please
watch the short video from YouTube, "Abib (Nisan) - The Jewish Month of
Abib (Nisan)" - www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nR2XgaG4k.

Abib is still under development at the time of writing, and when you
read this, an update could be available.  It is recommended to update
to the latest version, please check with the author, by email, as
there is no website now.  You can uninstall any earlier version of
Abib after installing the new one, just in case there is a problem
with the new one on your system.  You can keep the older versions if
you like as they are totally independent.

Before you read any more of this help-file, you could open another
instance of Abib, and drag it to one side, so you can try out the
instructions, as you read.  If you have opened this Help file with
Abib, you can get back to the Bible by clicking 'Back'.

Note: The display can be zoomed in and out by holding down Ctrl and
using the mouse wheel if you need larger print, or if you prefer
smaller print.

Abib is a simple Bible reading tool with the ability to rapidly find
passages of scripture. This can be useful while listening to a sermon,
especially online Zoom, YouTube and Facebook sessions, and the small
adjustable Abib window takes up little room.

Navigating to passages of scripture.
------------------------------------

There are three dropdown boxes for entry of passage references,
which makes Abib easier to use, and really does not need any
explanation.

What follows is a description of the older and faster,
keyboard method which you can learn if you are so disposed.
Otherwise, skip to "Moving backwards and forwards in the Bible".

To go to a particular book, enter the first one, two or three
letters of the book's name in the passage text box, which is to the
right of the three passage dropdown boxes.

Examples "na" when entered will take you to Nahum 1:1

"g" will go to Genesis 1:1

"php" will be Philippians 1:1

"phm" Philemon 1:1

Now to get to the exact verse desired: type your reference in the form
[Book][Chapter].[Verse]

For example, g50.7 will bring up Genesis 50:7

(There is no need to type the colon as the full stop is recognised, and
it is easier than typing the colon, e.g. with a numeric keypad.)

And notice there is no space between the g and the 5 as it is
unnecessary, but if you put one in, it will still work.

There is a quick way to move within the same chapter by just entering
the verse number.

So, let's say you have entered P119.1, and you want to move to verse 22
in the same Psalm, just enter 22 and press return.

There is another similar feature if you are in a particular book,
and you enter a floating-point number like, 3.16  It must be a full
stop here, a colon won't do; then wherever you are in the book you
will move to chapter 3 verse 16, if there is a 3:16 in the book -
otherwise it will beep.


Moving backwards and forwards in the Bible.
-------------------------------------------

1) One book at a time.

   Use F7 or the 'Book-' pushbutton to go to the previous book.

   Use F8 or the 'Book+' pushbutton to go forward to the next book.

2) One chapter at a time.

   Use F10 or the 'Chapter-' pushbutton to go to the previous chapter.

   Use F11 or the 'Chapter+' pushbutton to go forward to the next one.

3) By using the scrollbar.

4) The up and down arrow keys.

5) Page Up and Page Down keys.

6) The mouse scroll wheel.

7) You can move to the start of the Bible by pressing the Home key or
   to the end by pressing the End key, there are some blank lines at
   the end.

Make sure that the display window has the focus, except when entering a
passage reference in the text entry box.

After you move in the Bible to a new place, by any of the last five
methods, the cursor will remain where it was, and you will notice that
the passage reference in the status-bar did not change.

If you click on a verse and after that click on the window frame
somewhere, the status-bar will display the Bible reference.

This behaviour is uncorrected because it helps to facilitate the
ability to copy from the text.

8) Using the text entry box to enter an abbreviated passage reference.
For best results, it will be necessary to learn the abbreviations for
the names of the books. You can look them up in the index just before
Genesis.  Type 'g' for Genesis and then scroll back.  Many of the 
abbreviations can be shortened to one letter, generally the book that
appears first in the Bible will have the single letter shortcut i.e.,
'j' is for Joshua not Judges, Job, Jeremiah, Joel, Jonah, John, James
or Jude.  In fact, as there are so many books beginning with 'j' it is
essential to learn them, but it is not difficult.

Here is an improved copy of the index from the Bible.

The Find or Search feature.
---------------------------

Abib also has an easy-to-use basic search facility.

To search for a word or phrase in the Bible.

First click on the 'Find' button or press the F3 keyboard key.

The Find Options window will open.

There is a text entry box next to 'Find ?' here you can enter what
it is that you would like to search for.  Confirm your entry by
pressing Enter or clicking the 'OK' button.


There are four basic types of searches available to you. 

i)   "Raw search": Literal match unrestrained by word boundaries.

ii)  "Match whole words": Each word in your search key must be whole.
     The word, or phrase, is then matched with word(s) in the Bible
     text, on a verse-by-verse basis.

iii) "All the words": Another whole word search, but the words can
     be anywhere in the verse, word order does not matter, but they
     must all be in the verse.

iv)  "Any of the words": Similar to iii), but any of the words in your
     search key will be matched, and the results sorted.  Try using
     this to find rare words spelt differently like Melchisedec and
     Melchizedek i.e. "Find ?  Melchisedec Melchizedek" should find 11
     occurrences.  But watch out, it will not find 'Melchizedec' or
     'Melchisedek', these are misspellings.  The former of these gave
     me some trouble; I thought there was an error in the code.

     If you use the "Any of the words" search, the results will be
     sorted; the verses with the most matches are shown first, and in
     biblical book order for those results that have equal matches.
     Searching for common words will produce a high number of results,
     the sorted results will show the verses containing the most
     occurrences of these words, first.

All these search types can be either case matched or not.

These search types are selected by the four radio-buttons on the left
of the Find options window.

You can select only one of these.
This selects either search type (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv).


Search Scope:
-------------

You can limit the search scope with the two dropdown boxes in the
bottom right corner.


Regular Expression searches.
----------------------------

Firstly, if you have not used Regular Expressions before, please see
www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html.

Searching with regular expressions with Abib is just a matter of
selecting the Regular Expression radio button, choosing to match the
case or not with the checkbox, and then entering your regex in the
textbox.

There are many flavours of regular expressions, but the one used here
is that used in the Python programming language, and let me say that
I am a beginner here and have not tested beyond my rudimentary
knowledge.

For very basic use, you can replace letters in your search term with
the "." full stop/period character, this stands for any character.  So,
for example, "trial." will find "trial " and "trials" also "trial," and
trial:" and actually "trial.".

Then there is the OR character "|" or pipe, this will find either of
the words on either side of it.  For example, "Melchisedec|Melchizedek"
should find all of those references, with either spelling, Note: No
spaces in the middle or the search will include them.

Of course, you could just have put "Melchi.ede." and that will also
work, and find all 11 cases.

Just one more thing: If you surround your search word with "\b" at
either end, these are word boundaries, and you will get whole word
matches.  Say you want to search for "and" and you don't want "land"
and "sand" to appear in the results, type "\band\b" and you will get
just the "and" whole word results.  Try it.  Also, if you understand
using Regex better than me, please let me know if your searches don't
work as expected.


Installing the Bible font.
--------------------------

IMPORTANT
---------

Please read the README file to receive instructions on how to install
the Cascadia Mono font onto your system, which is highly recommended.
Cascadia Mono is an open-source Microsoft .ttf font that is part of
Cascadia Code.


Function Keys
-------------

Apart from the GUI controls which are self-evident and should need no
explanation, there are other keyboard controls that I will explain
here.

Some of these function key controls were originally derived from and
are compatible with their usage on the Online Bible project by Larry
Pierce.

This program (Abib), in earlier form and unpublished, has been used by
myself since 2004, and until 2021 it was not developed into a graphical
user interface, and so the keyboard was the only way to interact with
it.  It was, however, still fast and compact, and so, for at least my
own benefit, I have retained this, old school, method.

The Function keys:
------------------

F2       Passage entry
F3       Find
F4       Find Next
F5       Back (to last passage)
F6       Forward (...after Back)
F7       Go back one book
F8       Go forward one book
F9       Toggle Fullscreen
F10      Go back one chapter
F11      Go forward one chapter

Other keys:
-----------

PageUp   Go to screen before
PageDn   Go to screen after
Up       Go up one verse
Down     Go down one verse
Tab      Move the focus
Home     Move to the start
End      Move to the end
Q        Quit

Mouse wheel click is the same as F4


The 'æ' & 'Æ' characters appear in the Bible text in a few names,
listed below:

Alphæus, Arimathæa, Bartimæus, Cæsar, Cæsarea, Chaldæans, Epænetus,
Galilæan, Hymenæus, Idumæa, Ituræa, Judæa, Lebbæus, Prætorium,
Thaddæus, Timæus & Zacchæus.

plus

Æneas & Ænon.

These characters can be entered into the Find what: text entry box
either by copy and paste or they can be replaced by the two characters
'a' and 'e' or 'A' and 'E'.

Alternatively, they can be entered with special key sequences.

On Windows these are as follows:
--------------------------------

Hold down Alt type 0230 on the numeric keypad for 'æ'

Hold down Alt type 0198 on the numeric keypad for 'Æ'

On Linux:
---------

According to https://fsymbols.com/keyboard/linux/compose/
Where you can find more information than is provided here.

Compose key on GNOME

I hope it goes like this:

    1. Get into System ➣ Preferences ➣

       Keyboard ➣ Layouts.

    2. Open Layout Options.

    3. Expand the Compose key position menu. Here you can choose
       the preferred button that will turn on the composition mode.

Once you have a Compose key:

Compose Key ➣ a ➣ e for 'æ'.

Compose Key ➣ A ➣ E for 'Æ'.
However, for the most part, you can type 'ae' for 'æ' and 'AE' for 'Æ',
and Abib will interpret and convert it.


Another character that is different is the apostrophe.  Most modern
keyboards and text use the ['] character.  This was not used in the
PCE Bible but the character used is the [’].

So, to enter it in Windows:

Hold down Alt type 0146 on the numeric keypad giving '’'.

But don’t worry Abib also takes care of this, so you can use the ['].

Abib also takes care of the italic words, so you can enter plain
text in the "Find ?:" box.


Installing Abib on Linux.
-------------------------

Get the "Abib_linux_410.tar.bz2" file from the author.
Move it to your home folder or desired location and navigate there.
Expand the compressed archive with: tar -jxvf Abib_linux_410.tar.bz2

$ chmod +x Abib410 will make sure that the executable flag is set.

The command "./Abib410 11" will now start the program; however, it
needs to be in the same folder as all of its dependencies.
The 11 after ./Abib410 is for the default starting font size
(which you can change to suit).

Alternatively, if you have the Windows version installed, go to
C:\Program Files\ and copy the Abib410 folder onto a USB pen drive.
Copy the Abib410 folder from the USB drive to your home directory.
Now run Abib410 from the python script within the folder.

Concerning the Bible text:

IN THE UK,
RIGHTS IN THE AUTHORIZED (KING JAMES)
VERSION OF THE BIBLE
ARE VESTED IN THE CROWN.

This is the Pure Cambridge Edition (PCE).
By Matthew Verschuur, copyright 26 January 2007 (Australia Day).

Please see www.bibleprotector.com
The statement that follows is by Matthew Verschuur.

=======================================================================
Statement to all King James Bible (KJB) supporters concerning the Pure
Cambridge Edition (PCE).

By Matthew Verschuur, copyright 26 January 2007 (Australia Day).

Since the year 2000 I have contacted various King James Bible people
and organisations in regard to seeking out a certain text of King
James Bible, namely, a standard text of the Cambridge Edition.

For a long time the question, “Which King James Bible edition is
correct?” has not been properly answered by true Bible defenders.

We must acknowledge that there are indeed variations in various
historical and present editions of the King James Bible. Furthermore,
there has been a rising awareness in recent years concerning
“counterfeit” King James Bibles with “subtle changes”.

The Scripture promises that the Word of God should be preserved by God,
and this undergirding a sound King James Bible only doctrine. It is
consistent with this that there should be one correct received standard
edition of the King James Bible, where every word is pure
(Proverbs 30:5) to the jot and tittle (Matthew 5:18).

I do not agree with the claim that there is no standard or that any
edition of the King James Bible is sufficient. On the other side, those
who have said, “The 1769 Edition”, or “The Cambridge Edition” have been
too vague. Plainly, there have been changes in all editions since 1769,
and there are variations in Cambridge Bibles, such as the Victorian
text (circa 1830 to circa 1900), the Pure Cambridge Edition (circa 1900
to circa 1970s) which is also printed in many Collins editions, and the
Concord text (circa 1970s to circa 2000). Besides these, other
modernised variations appear in Bibles printed in America under the
name of Cambridge.

And then there is Scrivener’s Edition, which is clearly deficient on
many grounds, including that it has never been used by ordinary
Protestants every Sunday morning. Even worse is the New Cambridge
Paragraph Bible by David Norton, 2005, which makes many unacceptable
changes departing from all traditional King James Bibles.

Those who are knowledgeable about the King James Bible agree that the
Cambridge Edition is superior to the Oxford, Nelson or any other
edition. However, the particular variations in Cambridge Editions have
not been closely studied until now. That is, identifying which
Cambridge Edition is correct.

Sadly, many King James Bibles that follow the Cambridge Edition as are
now being produced or provided by King James Bible people are not the
correct Cambridge Edition, but follow the Concord Cambridge Edition,
which has departed from the pure text. The correct text has, among
other things, “rasor”, “inquire”, “counseller”, “expences”, “ancle”,
“Geba” at Ezra 2:26 and lower case “spirit” at Acts 11:12, 28 and
1John 5:8.

There has been a great ignorance of the fact that a final purification
took place in the history of the King James Bible. Those who have
studied the history of the King James Bible in depth would have been
aware of the major purification(s) that took place, such as the
editions of 1629, 1638 and 1769. There was also a proper purification
that took place circa 1900, which has resulted in the final text of the
King James Bible, which is in all ways the definitive presentation of
the King James Bible, and should not be altered.

I have now launched a website which details this area, and have also
freely made available an exactly correct electronic text of the King
James Bible (without typographical or edition variation errors). The
Pure Cambridge Edition is the historically received true text of the
Authorized Version.

Go to: www.bibleprotector.com

HOW TO KNOW THE

PURE CAMBRIDGE EDITION OF THE KING JAMES BIBLE

It is important to have the correct, perfect and final text of the King
James Bible, since there are correctors (e.g. publishers) who have
changed some aspects of King James Bible texts. The final form of the
King James Bible is the Pure Cambridge Edition (circa 1900), which
conforms to the following:

1. “or Sheba” not “and Sheba” in Joshua 19:2

2. “sin” not “sins” in 2 Chronicles 33:19

3. “Spirit of God” not “spirit of God” in Job 33:4

4. “whom ye” not “whom he” in Jeremiah 34:16

5. “Spirit of God” not “spirit of God” in Ezekiel 11:24

6. “flieth” not “fleeth” in Nahum 3:16

7. “Spirit” not “spirit” in Matthew 4:1

8. “further” not “farther” in Matthew 26:39

9. “bewrayeth” not “betrayeth” in Matthew 26:73

10. “Spirit” not “spirit” in Mark 1:12

11. “spirit” not “Spirit” in Acts 11:28

12. “spirit” not “Spirit” in 1 John 5:8
